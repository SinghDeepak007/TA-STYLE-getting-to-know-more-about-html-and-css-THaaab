          <p>About 20 years ago, I typed Google.com into my web browser for the first time. It loaded a search bar and buttons. I punched in ‚ÄúD.M.V. sample test,‚Äù scrolled through the results and clicked on a site.

            Wow, I thought to myself. Google‚Äôs minimalist design was a refreshing alternative to other search engines at the time ‚Äî remember AltaVista, Yahoo! and Lycos? ‚Äî which greeted us with a jumble of ads and links to news articles. Even better, Google seemed to show more up-to-date, relevant results.
            
            And the entire experience took just a few seconds. Once I found the link I needed, I was done with Google.
            
            Two decades later, my experience with Google is considerably different. When I do a Google search in 2020, I spend far more time in the internet company‚Äôs universe. If I look for chocolate chips, for example, I see Google ads for chocolate chips pop up at the top of my screen, followed by recipes that Google has scraped from across the web, followed by Google Maps and Google Reviews of nearby bakeries, followed by YouTube videos for how to bake chocolate chip cookies. (YouTube, of course, is owned by Google.)</p>

            <p>On Instagram, the main intention is to share and find the best photos and videos. Every user profile has follower and following counts, representing how many people they follow and how many other users are following them.

                If you want to follow someone, go to their user profile and tap Follow. If a user has their profile set to private, they must first approve your request.
                
                If you create a public account, anyone can find and view your profile, along with your photos and videos. Set your Instagram profile to private if you want only the people you approve to see your posts. If you're under 16 when you create your profile, it will start as private by default. You can still make it public afterward, however.
                
                Interacting on posts is fun and easy. Double-tap any post to like it, or tap the speech bubble to add a comment. Click the arrow button to share a post with someone using Instagram Direct. Facebook Messenger has been integrated into Instagram's direct messaging, so you can direct message Facebook contacts from Instagram.</p>

                <p>Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read those that are publicly available. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its APIs. Prior to April 2020, services were accessible via SMS.[14] The service is provided by Twitter, Inc., a corporation based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[15] Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017.[16] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.</p>
