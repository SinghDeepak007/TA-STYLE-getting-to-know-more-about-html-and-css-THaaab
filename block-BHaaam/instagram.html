        <p>On Instagram, the main intention is to share and find the best photos and videos. Every user profile has follower and following counts, representing how many people they follow and how many other users are following them.

                If you want to follow someone, go to their user profile and tap Follow. If a user has their profile set to private, they must first approve your request.
                
                If you create a public account, anyone can find and view your profile, along with your photos and videos. Set your Instagram profile to private if you want only the people you approve to see your posts. If you're under 16 when you create your profile, it will start as private by default. You can still make it public afterward, however.
                
                Interacting on posts is fun and easy. Double-tap any post to like it, or tap the speech bubble to add a comment. Click the arrow button to share a post with someone using Instagram Direct. Facebook Messenger has been integrated into Instagram's direct messaging, so you can direct message Facebook contacts from Instagram.</p>
